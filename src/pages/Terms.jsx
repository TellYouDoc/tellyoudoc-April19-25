              TellYouDoc is a digital healthcare platform designed to facilitate
              communication and interaction between patients, caregivers, and
              healthcare professionals (doctors). The Platform aims to provide a
              convenient and accessible means for users to manage their
              health-related needs, including but not limited to, booking
              appointments, accessing health information, and communicating with
              doctors. The Platform is currently focused on breast cancer care
              but will expand to include other medical conditions and services,
              such as pill management, chemotherapy management, and general
              diseases. The Platform is provided free of charge to both doctors
              and patients.
